# Project: Lilo & Stitch Stunt Operations Log - Incident 626-Alpha

## Repository Overview

This document serves as a formal (read: slightly exaggerated and definitely painful) recounting of a particular 'event' during the production cycle involving Experiment 626, affectionately known as "Stitch." While standard stunt work involves meticulous planning and safety protocols, the presence of extraterrestrial life and a mischievous little girl adds... variables.

Consider this less a script breakdown and more a survivor's manual entry.

## Stuntman Profile

   Name: "Lefty" O'Malley (The nickname is less about a dominant hand and more about what's left after some jobs).
   Experience: 20+ years in the industry. Specializing in high falls, vehicular mayhem, and convincingly losing fights against protagonists significantly smaller than me.
   Recent Expertise Added: Successfully being launched by alien plasma weapons, enduring unscripted bites, developing immunity to vaguely corrosive alien slobber.
   Certification: Union Member (barely), holder of a Hawaiian Driver's License (for trucks that aren't hovercraft), surprisingly good at playing the ukulele after dislocating a shoulder.

## The 'Ohana Cinematic Universe (OCU) - Set Challenges

Filming anything involving Lilo Pelekai and Stitch is less a movie production and more controlled chaos with cameras.

   Unpredictable Talent: Stitch is a professional. A professional agent of chaos. His moves are rarely the same take-to-take. Scripted choreography? Adorable theory.
   Environmental Hazards: Beyond the usual sand, surf, and rogue coconuts, we deal with:
       Jumba's "failed" experiments (which often succeed at being hazards).
       Pleakley's... fashion choices (tripping hazards).
       Sudden gravity fluctuations (rare, but noted).
       Pudge the fish controlling the weather (unconfirmed by studio, confirmed by my last concussion).
   The "Ê»Ohana" Factor: While heartwarming, the strong family bond means everyone, including the aliens, gets involved. This often means a simple pratfall might involve being unexpectedly cushioned by a five-eyed alien or tripped by a small girl yelling "Cousin!"

## Incident Log: The Great Tiki Fall of '03

Codename: Operation: "Don't Touch That Tiki!"

Scene: A seemingly innocent sequence where Lilo and Stitch are decorating for a small beach party. A critical prop â€“ a ridiculously large, unstable wooden tiki statue â€“ needs to be carefully moved. My job? Be the guy who doesn't move it but gets comically crushed near it when something goes wrong. Standard stuff.

Setup:
1.  Massive, hollow, balsa-wood tiki statue erected. Looked impressive, felt like plywood dreams.
2.  Stunt mark designated for my crushing (a nice soft spot of sand, thank you very much).
3.  Lilo positioned to point dramatically.
4.  Stitch... well, Stitch was given a lei and told to look festive. Big mistake.

The Plan (Theoretically):
Stitch was supposed to pretend to push the base gently. I'd see it wobble, react in slow-motion panic, and "escape" just as it tipped, ending up sprawled nearby as it crashed. Minimal impact, maximum comedy.

## Executing the Maneuver (vs. The Reality)

Lights... Camera... Action!

Lilo points. I see the tiki. I start my slow-motion shuffle of terror. Stitch gets his cue.

Now, what happened next is debated. Jumba later claimed it was an accidental "graviton anomaly." Pleakley blamed static cling from his outfit. I blame Stitch's over-enthusiasm combined with a likely sugar rush.

Instead of a gentle pretend push, Stitch â€“ with the force of a small, blue, furry bulldozer â€“ vaulted onto the top of the tiki's head.

Sequence of Unplanned Events:

1.  Stitch lands on the tiki's head. The balsa-wood structure groans like a homesick space whale.
2.  The tiki doesn't just tip, it lurches violently sideways, directly towards my designated "safe" spot.
3.  My slow-motion panic instantly becomes actual, non-choreographed terror.
4.  I dive. Not a stunt dive. A primal, survival-instinct dive.
5.  Mid-air, I hear Jumba yell, "Oops! Perhaps too much antigrav paint!"
6.  The tiki, instead of simply falling, seems to briefly hover thanks to said paint, then executes a weird, twisting maneuver before finally deciding gravity was back on.
7.  It didn't just crush the sand next to me. It managed to land perfectly, and I mean perfectly, on the small cooler I'd foolishly left just outside my mark with my lunch inside.

## Post-Stunt Analysis & Wrap-up

Injuries Sustained:

   Severe emotional trauma (watching my Spam musubi get obliterated).
   Mild sprain (from the unplanned panic dive).
   Residual tingling sensation (suspected antigrav residue).
   Temporary flattening of hair (wind from the near-miss).
   Crushed dignity (standard for this job).

Lessons Learned:

   Never leave your lunch anywhere on set. Ever.
   Stitch's involvement requires exponential increases in safety margins. And possibly a lead-lined suit.
   Jumba's explanations are rarely comforting and often precede further incidents.
   Balsa wood tiki statues have unexpected aerodynamic properties when coated in alien tech.

The Payoff:

The shot looked fantastic. My reaction, while genuine panic, apparently read as Oscar-worthy comedic timing. Lilo hugged me (which helped a little). Stitch tried to help me up, but I suspected he just wanted to see if I'd bounce.

Would I do it again? For the Ê»ohana? Maybe. For a fresh Spam musubi? Definitely.

## Contributing (to my recovery fund)

See agent for details. They might still be in therapy from the last production meeting.

## Contact (via carrier pigeon)

Standard communication methods are unreliable around Stitch. Do not send messages via Plerg flarg.
